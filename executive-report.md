# 1 Introduction

<!-- 150-200 words -->

This executive report provides a brief but comprehensive insight into the proposed Information Security Policy Framework containing policies and procedures that are specifically designed for the company to be compliant with UK governmental security requirements. Since this is a "high-priority", "high-visibility" project with a significant revenue incentive (30%), it is important to demonstrate relevant compliance with all necessary regulations.

The mentioned framework covers a wide range of policy areas, most notably data protection, secure configurations, risk management, access controls, incident response, and much more. The policies are matched to an according UK standards, such as NCSC guidelines, the Data Protection Act 2018, and NIST controls, to name a few.

Integrating this framework into the company's IT infrastructure, will not only secure the company's assets (i.e. systems and data assets) but also guarantee that it satisfies contracts with the UK Government. The report will also address policies and procedures which are marked as "$High$" within the framework, as well as key security controls to deal with them, supporting policies marked as "$Medium$" which supplement the main policies, and finally a high-level implementation plan to practically meet the criteria of this framework.

The recommendations and the plan provided by the framework, if adopted correctly by the company, can demonstrate its competence in its information security practices, and risk mitigation as identified in the previous risk assessment, and form a robust security foundation for the company that will undoubtedly help with future contracts.

## 2.1 Access control policy

<!-- 150-200 words -->

A strong access control procedure ensures that only authorised individuals of the organisation can access components of the IT infrastructure, data, systems, and applications based on their permissions and applicable business needs. By enforcing the principle of least privilege in line with Article 5 of GDPR [@intersoftconsulting2], it will limit access rights for users to perform their necessary job functions. By deliberating excess permissions can increase risks of insider threats and potentially result in internal data breaches.

This policy is in alignment with access control requirements detailed in the NIST Special Publication 800-171 [@nist2020] and the UK Government Security Policy Framework [@govuk2022]. Key elements of this policy will include:

- Regular reviews of user access rights with the intention to promote lesser privileges
- Multi-factor authentication algorithms for systems that handle sensitive data
- Stricter controls around admin-level access systems
- Logging and monitoring mechanisms
- Swiftly revoking access for terminated employees

This policy, enforced through technical controls too, is vital for managing which users have access company assets to prevent unathorised access.
