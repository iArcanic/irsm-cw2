# 1 Introduction

<!-- 150-200 words -->

This executive report provides a brief but comprehensive insight into the proposed Information Security Policy Framework containing policies and procedures that are specifically designed for the high-tech 400 employee company to be compliant with UK governmental security requirements. Since this is a "high-priority", "high-visibility" project with a significant revenue incentive (30%), it is important to demonstrate relevant compliance with all necessary regulations. It is also worth nothing that currently, the company does not have any policies or controls in place which are government compliant as of yet.

The mentioned framework covers a wide range of policy areas, most notably data protection, secure configurations, risk management, access controls, incident response, and much more. The policies are matched to an according UK standards, such as NCSC guidelines, the Data Protection Act 2018 [@govuk2018], and NIST controls, to name a few.

Integrating this framework into the company's IT infrastructure, will not only secure the company's assets (i.e. systems and data assets) but also guarantee that it satisfies contracts with the UK Government. The report will also address policies and procedures which are marked as "$High$" within the framework, as well as key security controls to deal with them, supporting policies marked as "$Medium$" which supplement the main policies, and finally a high-level implementation plan to practically meet the criteria of this framework.

The recommendations and the plan provided by the framework, if adopted correctly by the company, can demonstrate its competence in its information security practices, and risk mitigation as identified in the previous risk assessment, and form a robust security foundation for the company that will undoubtedly help with future contracts.

# 2 High priority policies and procedures

<!-- 600-700 words -->

## 2.1 Access Control Policy

<!-- 150-200 words -->

A strong Access Control Policy ensures that only authorised individuals of the organisation can access components of the IT infrastructure, data, systems, and applications based on their permissions and applicable business needs. By enforcing the principle of least privilege in line with Article 5 of GDPR [@intersoftconsulting2], it will limit access rights for users to perform their necessary job functions. By deliberating excess permissions can increase risks of insider threats and potentially result in internal data breaches. Specifically, this applies to components of the IT infrastructure, such as the Active Directory environment, ERP applications, email servers, and all endpoint devices.

This policy is in alignment with access control requirements detailed in the NIST Special Publication 800-171 [@nist2020] and the UK Government Security Policy Framework [@govuk2022]. Key elements of this policy will include:

- Regular reviews of user access rights with the intention to promote lesser privileges
- Multi-factor authentication algorithms for systems that handle sensitive data
- Stricter controls around admin-level access systems
- Logging and monitoring mechanisms
- Swiftly revoking access for terminated employees

This policy, enforced through technical controls too, is vital for managing which users have access company assets to prevent unathorised access.

## 2.2 Data Protection Policy

<!-- 150-200 words -->

Securing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the company's data is essential. Therefore, this Data Protection Policy will outline some measures that are compliant with both the UK Data Protection Act 2018 [@govuk2018] and UK GDPR [@eu2016] requirements.

Key aspects of this policy will include:

- Encrypting sensitive data in systems such as in ERP, email security solutions like Symantec, and other private stores
- Data classification guidelines to accurately define what data is sensitive
- Breach notifications and processes that are in compliance with GDPR Article 33 [@intersoftconsulting]
- Clear defines roles and responsibilities for both data owners and users
- Compulsory security awareness training for users and employees to undergo before interacting with company systems
- Third-party data processing management and controls
- Processes and procedures for data handling including its lifecycle (i.e. creation and destruction)
- Technical controls, such as encryption, logging, access restrictions, and so on

The rigorous enforcement of this policy will arguably help to protect one of the company's most important assets and demonstrate to governments a strong commitment to ensuring, at all times, the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this data.

## 2.3 Risk Management Policy

A fully encompassing Risk Management Policy is intrinsic to forming a workable information security program. The policy will encourage systematic and regular risk assessments to be conducted (similar to the previous one) across the IT infrastructure landscape (Windows Server, Active Directory, ERP, R&D, Linux systems), including people, processes, systems, applications, data, and any other related assets. Potential risks will be identified as a result of this, and are rated by their likelihood of occurring and the impact that they would have on general business operations.

This Risk Management Policy was inspired by best practice frameworks such as NIST SP 800-39 [@nist2011] and ISO 27001 [@iso2022] whilst also in alignment with the UK Government's Cyber Essentials [@ncsc2023]. This policy takes into account the following criteria:

- Identifying vulnerable assets, threats they are at risk to, and risk scenarios
- Calculating the impact of risk exposure both quantitatively and qualitatively
- Selecting and deciding the best implementation techniques on risk treatment options
- Deciding upon a long term risk monitoring and review process

Integrating the specific security controls and measures will be heavily influenced by the risks identified in the risk register and recommendations as a result of the risk assessment. Such an approach can confirm that resources and security efforts are coordinated to be efficiently focussed on mitigating the highest priority risks to the company.

## 2.4 Encryption Policy

<!-- 150-200 words -->

Encryptions controls will allow for any sensitive data that the company holds to be effectively retained securely for its confidentiality but also to comply with UK governmental standards. This Encryption Policy will serve as a directive to use industry level cryptographic algorithms across the IT infrastructure landscape.

This policy considers data when its in three different states:

- Data at rest: all confidential data stored on endpoint devices, removable media, servers, backups, and so on must be encrypted using a protocol mentioned in NIST's FIPS 140-2 [@nist2001] with a key of a suitable length that balances both performance and security
- Data in transit: transmission of sensitive data taking place over untrusted or public networks should utilise technical protocols with authorised cipher suites
- Backup data: Confidential data should be encrypted effectively to protect against breaches or exposure risks during either transit or storage

Regarding cryptographic key management, this policy also specifies requirements with respect to key management lifecycle stages [@warner2022]. Those being periodic key rotation, recovery processes, key storage, and retrieval, all in alignment with NCSC guidelines [@ncsc2022].

In addition, this policy also disallows the use of third-party or insecure cryptographic algorithms that are not widely recognised or documented by standards such as NIST or FIPS or included within the the UK government cipher recommendations.

Regular attention to this Encryption Policy will allow for sensitive data to be protected at all times and enforce regulatory compliance.

## 2.5 Secure Configuration Policy

<!-- 150-200 words -->

A hardening criteria and secure configuration baseline is foundational for minimising the attack surface on the company's technology assets. The Secure Configuration Policy determines strict standards and settings needed for securing technical assets such as servers, network devices, and endpoint devices to stop threat actors from exploiting weak configurations.

It is recommended to follow the vendor's hardening guidelines rather than individual configuration. This is in agreement with Center of Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks, that are provided for each type of device and operating system. This is especially for server components such as Linux Ubuntu web servers and Windows Server 2022 which in itself provides AD, DNS, and DHCP. It means that areas like applying the latest patches, security logging, and unnecessary service disabling are all covered.

In the same way for endpoint devices such as employee Windows workstations and laptops, the policy entails that the NCSC End User Device (EUD) Security Guidance [@2ncsc2022] along with the appropriate CIS benchmarks be consolidated within the IT infrastructure for a robust defense.

The policy will mandate formality when managing configurations, and also when migrating from one hardening baseline to another. Variations need to be approved to ensure that they follow verified benchmarks and have a risk assessment conducted upon it. The result from this assessment will provide confidence that the existing IT infrastructure is not compromised. Furthermore, it should also be throughly tested in a production environment and monitored for a short period of time before it can be fully marked as functional and secure.

# 3 Key security controls

<!-- 400-500 words -->

## 3.1 Access controls

<!-- 100 words -->

Access controls will be implemented via a unified Identity Access Management (IAM) system. Through this, it will include:

- A Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) scheme for controlling permissions on a granular level through integration with Active Directory
- Automated and periodic user account activation and deactivation via Microsoft Endpoint Manager
- Audit logging and monitoring schemes of access activities and permission granting or revoking such as Microsoft Event Viewer
- Multi-factor authentication protocols for access to Microsoft environments such as Active Directory and Exchange

These IAM controls will span across the whole IT infrastructure landscape such as on-site system, cloud applications, and external third-party systems. It also fits in with the principle of least privilege.

## 3.2 Data protection controls

<!-- 100 words -->

Data protection controls will maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the company's sensitive data assets. These include:

- Data classification and post processing actions based on sensitivity and value of the data such as by using Microsoft BitLocker
- Data loss prevention mechanisms such as Microsoft Defender to help recover data in the event of unauthorised data usage or transfer
- Anti-malware scanning and email filtering through Symantec Email Security
- Secure backup schemes with thorough data restoration protocols and offsite storage
- Encryption of data at rest, in transit, and when being backed-up

Having multi-layered controls makes it significantly harder when a malicious threat actor intents to penetrate security defenses.

## 3.3 Risk management controls

<!-- 100 words -->

In-depth risk management controls will help to methodically pinpoint, evaluate, and analyse information security risks across the company's IT infrastructure. For this, it will include:

- Continuous risk monitoring, suggested action paths, and reviews based on previous actions taken to address the risk
- Integration and synchronisation with other control areas, such as incident response and vulnerability management
- Thorough risk calculation method with factors such as impact, likelihood, and other factors
- Maintaining a company wide risk register that is constantly updated with the latest risks, threat scenarios, and vulnerability data from risk assessments conducted or credible cybersecurity vendors covering risks on Active Directory, Symantec products, and Microsoft Server

The controls here will ultimately lead to a more structured approach, where data is placed at the forefront of the assets to protect. These controls are in agreement with well known frameworks such as NIST 800-39 [@nist2011] and ISO 27001 [@iso2022].

## 3.4 Cryptographic controls

<!-- 100 words -->

Most of the policies highlighted in this report along with the previous controls rely upon strong technical cryptographic measures to protect sensitive data traversing the organisation's systems. The controls should be appropriate for Microsoft environments. The ways in which this can be achieved are as follows:

- Only cryptographic modules, which are validated by FIPS 140-2 [@nist2001] with a keys using of a minimum length of 256 bits will be used
- AES encryption to be used for encryption of data at rest, or any other similar algorithm
- Data in transit over networks that are untrusted will use protocols such as TLS (exceeding version 1.2), SSH, and IPsec
- All stages in the cryptographic key management lifecycle should be thoroughly documented and updated if any changed do occur
- Verify key storage means, such as if the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Hardware Security Module (HSM) used are secure themselves
- Any insecure algorithms, protocols, ciphers, or cryptography logic that does not confirm to the NIST's FIPS 140-2 [@nist2001] framework or NCSC guidelines will be disallowed

The controls here, based on certified cybersecurity frameworks and industry best practices will help in providing strong protection against threats concerning data.

## 3.5 Secure baseline configurations

<!-- 100 words -->

Secure baseline configurations with hardening guidelines can considerably reduce the attack surface from threats on company systems and endpoint devices. This can be through:

- Implementation of Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmark recommendations based on the specific OS being used for servers, network devices, and so on
- Removal and disabling of unused services, protocols, and ports based on results of a technical risk assessment
- Consistent and regular patches from credible and official sources only, such as Microsoft
- Following the Change Management Policy when business needs require deviations from established baselines
- Reliable security logging, auditing, monitoring, and informative documentation on activities of IT components
- Using built-in Microsoft security configurations and server templates

Aligning secure baseline configurations with industry standard recommendations will help in remediating vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited.

# 4 Implementation approach

<!-- 400-500 words -->

A practical implementation of the Information Security Framework will require a detailed deployment plan, comprehensive change management processes, and well defined responsibilities spanning the organisation. Through following this planned implementation road map in addition to introducing established roles and change management processes, the company can effectively adhere to the Information Security Framework in a sustainable manner.

## 4.1 Deployment plan

The implementation of this framework will followed an approach separated into tiers or phases. Each phase will prioritise a vital security aspect first as this well help get all IT components to the required compliance level.

### 4.1.1 Phase 1: Demonstrate oversight and governance

- Form a reliable and well-informed information security governance committee with sponsorship from company executives
- Have clear security roles allocated to qualified individuals, those being CISO, administrators (both technical and non-technical), and security designers
- From the Risk Management Policy, enforce a risk management program
- Carry out a gap analysis on the existing IT infrastructure against the defined policies to establish a compliance baseline

### 4.1.2 Phase 2: Consider baseline controls

- From the Secure Configuration Policy, administer secure configuration for IT infrastructure components (endpoint devices, servers, networks)
- Access controls, permission, and identity management should be implemented
- Incident response capabilities should be set up, including security monitoring and logging

### 4.1.3 Phase 3: Prioritise data protection

- Enforce regulatory compliance, such as with the Data Protection Act 2018 [@govuk2018], GDPR [@eu2016], and so on
- Activate data protection controls, such as classification, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools, and encryption measures
- Establish data backup and recovery processes

## 4.2 Change management

Updates or changed to the information security framework depending upon evolving business needs need to follow all procedures outlined in the Change Management Policy. This involves:

- Conducted risk assessments, workflows tested and approved before integrating within IT infrastructure
- Logging and auditing the implemented changes and their impacts, monitoring whether they compromise existing assets
- Have emergency provisions to rollback changes in the event that they jeopardise existing IT components

### 4.2.1 Roles and responsibilities

Having clear roles and responsibilities across multiple stakeholder categories, such as IT operations, management, and security teams will also be considered under change management processes.

- Executive sponsors: consists of a funding and resource program to support information security endeavors
- CISO/security teams: provide oversight into the program, help to maintain and implement policies, and oversee security operations
- IT operations: encompasses system administration, technical implementation of high-level controls
- Data owners: management of data usage, flows, and transfers along compliance with the related policies and regulations
- Employees/company personnel: comply with the Acceptable Use Policy and undertake mandatory security and compliance training
- Third parties: confirm that third party vendors that the company relies upon comply to a coordinated policy
